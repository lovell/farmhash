# farmhash

Node.js implementation of Google's
[FarmHash](https://github.com/google/farmhash)
family of very fast hash functions.

FarmHash is the successor to CityHash.
Functions in the FarmHash family are not suitable for cryptography.
A fast, cryptographically-secure alternative is
[HighwayHash](https://github.com/lovell/highwayhash).

As the V8 JavaScript engine only natively supports 32-bit unsigned integers,
the 64-bit methods return strings instead of Numbers
and the 128-bit methods are not implemented.

This module uses FarmHash v1.1.0 (2015-03-01).
It has been tested with Node.js v0.10, v0.12, v4, v6
on Linux, OS X and Windows.

## Installation

```sh
npm install farmhash
```

Flag `-march=native` is passed to C compiler by default, which can be
problematic if CPU of the build host is not the same as CPU of where the code
is executed (will cause `115 Illegal instruction` during startup).

You can specify another machine architecture during `npm install` phase:

    npm install farmhash --farmhash-arch=core2

Note that disabling compiler optimizations will cause performance impact.
Measure first.

## Usage

```javascript
var farmhash = require('farmhash');
```

```javascript
var hash = farmhash.hash32('test');
console.log(typeof hash); // 'number'
```

```javascript
var hash = farmhash.hash64(new Buffer('test'));
console.log(typeof hash); // 'string'
```

```javascript
var hash = farmhash.hash64WithSeed('test', 123);
console.log(typeof hash); // 'string'
```

```javascript
var hash = farmhash.fingerprint32(new Buffer('test'));
console.log(typeof hash); // 'number'
```

```javascript
var hash = farmhash.fingerprint64('test');
console.log(typeof hash); // 'string'
```

## API

### Hash

The hash methods are platform dependent.
Different CPU architectures, for example 32-bit vs 64-bit, Intel vs ARM, SSE4.2 vs AVX
might produce different results for a given input.

#### hash32(input)

* `input` is the Buffer or String to hash.

Returns a Number containing the 32-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.

#### hash32WithSeed(input, seed)

* `input` is the Buffer or String to hash.
* `seed` is an integer Number to use as a seed.

Returns a Number containing the 32-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.

#### hash64(input)

* `input` is the Buffer or String to hash.

Returns a String representing the 64-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.

#### hash64WithSeed(input, seed)

* `input` is the Buffer or String to hash.
* `seed` is an integer Number to use as a seed.

Returns a String representing the 64-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.

#### hash64WithSeeds(input, seed1, seed2)

* `input` is the Buffer or String to hash.
* `seed1` and `seed2` are integer Numbers to use as seeds.

Returns a String representing the 64-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.

#### hash32v1(input)

Legacy function to access v1 of the FarmHash implementation.

* `input` is the Buffer or String to hash.

Returns a Number containing the 32-bit unsigned integer v1 hash value of `input`.

### Fingerprint

The fingerprint methods are platform independent, producing the same results for a given input on any machine.

#### fingerprint32(input)

* `input` is the Buffer or String to fingerprint.

Returns a Number containing the 32-bit unsigned integer fingerprint value of `input`.

#### fingerprint64(input)

* `input` is the Buffer or String to fingerprint.

Returns a String representing the 64-bit unsigned integer fingerprint value of `input`.
